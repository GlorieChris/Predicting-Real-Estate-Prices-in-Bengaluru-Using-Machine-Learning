# Predicting Real Estate Prices in Bengaluru Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project analyzes key factors affecting real estate prices in Bengaluru and develops a machine learning model to predict property values. The dataset includes features like location, size, total square footage, number of bathrooms, and balcony count.

## Problem Statement
The dynamic Bengaluru real estate market makes price estimation challenging for buyers, sellers, and investors. This model helps estimate fair market values by considering multiple property characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 13,320 property listings with features:
- Location
- Size (converted to bedrooms)
- Total square footage (processed from mixed formats)
- Number of bathrooms
- Balcony count
- Price (target variable)

## Key Steps
1. Data exploration and cleaning
2. Feature engineering (created price_per_sqft, processed total_sqft)
3. Outlier detection and handling
4. Location binning (grouping rare locations)
5. [Add model development steps when completed]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bengaluru-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction.git
